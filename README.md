# babel-plugin-webpack-alias-resolve

This repository borrowed the ideas of [`babel-plugin-webpack-alias`](https://github.com/trayio/babel-plugin-webpack-alias).

Because I can't resolve the real path of alias by use function except `require()`, so I modified the source code and make it fit with function `resolve`.
